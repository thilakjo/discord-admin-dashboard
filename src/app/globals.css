/* Important Notes:
   - Components like Sidebar and Navbar are intentionally designed to be dark
     (bg-discordDark) regardless of the primary theme, so their styles don't need 'dark:' prefixes.
   - The <main> content area in app/layout.tsx uses 'dark:' prefixes directly
     to switch its background and text based on the 'dark' class on 'html'.
